# RightTriangleSolver

This version provides a list of variables and constants required.  It also provides an outline of the tasks required in order for the project to be completed successfully in the comments.  Finally, it provides a helper file that includes functions that will complete all of the tasks required.  There is an example of how to use the functions in the main.swift file.  HINT:  YOU SHOULD NOT COPY/PASTE THE FUNCTIONS INTO THE MAIN.SWIFT file!!!

You will need to use the functions provided along with CONTROL FLOW of your own design to complete the project.
